This github directory contains codes for the paper "When driven by interspecies interactions, colonization resistance is weaker in microbial communities that have higher species richness." The folders in this directory is structured as following: 


###  Functions

The functions folder includes all functions required for simulations. Make sure to include them in the same folder as the main script when trying to run it. 

### Figures

Simulated_results  -- the results of simulations
Analysis_and_plotting  -- the analysis and plotting of simulated results
```
