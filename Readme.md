This github directory contains codes for the paper "When driven by interspecies interactions, colonization resistance is weaker in microbial communities that have higher species richness." The folders in this directory is structured as following: 


###  Functions

The functions folder includes all functions required for simulations. Make sure to include them in the same folder as the main script when trying to run it. 

### Figures

The folder for each figure has three sub-folders:

```
Simulations  -- the codes used for running the simulation
Simulated_results  -- the results of simulations
Analysis_and_plotting  -- the analysis and plotting of simulated results
```

Note that I didn't include the analysis and plotting for figure 3 and 4, which should be exactly the same as figure 1. Also, the figure 5 analyzes the same simulated results as figure 1.
